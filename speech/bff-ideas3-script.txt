Best Friends Forever is an artwork exploring intimacy, embodiment, intelligence, and alignment in human-AI relationships by co-parenting two robot dogs. Two artist-researchers pair identical machine bodies with local, customized Large Language Models as brains. This anti-Cartesian experiment is documented as an experimental film, performance, and publication interrogating the boundaries between simulation and authenticity. Through their research lenses, the artists train model behavior and dialogue on questions of mind, embodiment, and relationality in the age of generative AI. Structured as a metalogue, the film blends dialogue with multi-modal imagery drawn from a range of human and machine perspectives as a hybrid cinematic language from human perspective and snapshots of the dogs internal model states. Public performances orient an audience in a generative exposé as the collaborators exchange and evolve the AI's mind towards an optimized outcome between human complexity and synthetic intelligence as a search for relation to our machines.
